                <p>The History faculty strives to make outstanding scholarly contributions to the discipline and to instill historical knowledge, perspective on human experience, critical thinking skills, and effective writing in all our graduate and undergraduate students. We are also a community of citizens engaged in service and devoted to the enrichment of intellectual and public life at the University, throughout Utah, and beyond.</p>

                <p>We offer the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees. History
                    students can explore periods and regions ranging
                    from ancient Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome to the
                    modern Middle East, Asia, Europe, and the Americas.
                    Our faculty specializes in topics that include politics,
                    diplomacy, warfare, and intellectual life as well as
                    gender and women’s history, medicine and science,
                    colonialism and intercultural contact, religious
                    expression and practices, and environmental history. Our curriculum reflects long-standing disciplinary
                    tradition in its organization by region, nation-state,
                    and time period, but it also embodies a newer
                    orientation toward transnational, comparative, and
                    thematic courses. Faculty involvement in Middle
                    Eastern Studies, Gender Studies, Asian Studies, Ethnic Studies, International Studies, Latin American Studies, and Environmental Studies reflects the department’s long- standing commitment to interdisciplinary programs.</p>
                <p>History courses emphasize written and oral skills, analysis and critical thinking, and the ability to assess conflicting interpretations. These skills prepare students for the responsibilities of citizenship and cultivate an awareness of the complexities of life. History provides valuable preparation for careers in university and college teaching and research, primary and secondary education, law, government, public service, journalism, libraries and museums, international business, and medicine.</p>
